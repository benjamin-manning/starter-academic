### **Professional**

I am a master's student at the Harvard Kennedy School focusing on the intersections of decision making, data science, and leadership. I have done research in management and political science at both Dartmouth College and Harvard, with additional experience teaching and working in quantitative finance. Following the completition of my master's program, I plan to pursue a PhD focusing on human behavior and decision making. Particularly, I want to do research using data to analyze bias and judgment under uncertainty. I am currently looking for full-time employment beginning May 2021.
 
### **Personal**

Outside of my work you can find me: hiking in New Hampshire, cycling, playing soccer, reading and subsequently napping, aggressively playing Settlers of Catan, noodling on the guitar, traveling to random places, or simply spending time with friends.
